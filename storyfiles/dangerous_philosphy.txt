# Any line prefaced by a '#' character is not interpreted by the importer.
# They can function as comments.

# The file is broken up into two major sections: metadata and content
# Metadata is an optional section if using the importing with already
# existing author and gamebook fields (ie, when just adding pages).
# Each major sections is delineated by **[name]**, with each 
# subsection marked with *[name]*. This will help keep error
# reporting informational, as it will be easier to tell what's
# missing or incorrectly formatted.

# Establish information about the book
**METADATA**

# Start with a section declaring Author info
